### **Overview:**
For this project I was hired by Horiseon Social Solutions, Inc to take their exisiting website and make it more accessible. Accessibility is an extremely important aspect for businesses to include with their webpages, as it gives people using assistive technology full access to the web. Better accessibility also grants better search engine optimization. 

**The following tasks were done to meet better accessibilty standards:**
- Changed all DIV tags to semantic HTML tags including: Header, Footer, Nav, Main, Section, and Aside
- Added descriptive alt text to all images
- Cleaned up CSS element styles to be more concise
- Ensured all links worked properly
- Added title "Horiseon Social Soulution Services"
